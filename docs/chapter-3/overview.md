## Overview

Lorem markdownum vides aram est sui istis excipis Danai elusaque manu fores.
Illa hunc primo pinum pertulit conplevit portusque pace *tacuit* sincera. Iam

## Lab 1.4 - Exploring the Aviatrix Gateways
### Description
As you can see from the lab diagram, there are already some Aviatrix gateways deployed. Let’s see where we can find them in the controller.
### Validate
Go to **_Multi-Cloud Transit -> List_**. As you can see, this is where the existing transit gateways are listed. Look at the following fields: Name, VPC CIDR, Spoke List and Transit Peering. Try to derive the existing topology as seen on the lab diagram from this information.  
### Expected Results
You should be able to view the VPC / VNET and Gateway Route Tables for both the Transit Gateways and Spoke Gateways.
