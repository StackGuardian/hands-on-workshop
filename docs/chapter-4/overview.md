# Lab 3  

## Security Features
Lab time: ~45 minutes  

In this lab, we are going to explore some of the security features that Aviatrix provides. Currently we have open and unlimited communication between all VPC’s and VNET’s and Site2Cloud connection. We rely on security groups/NSG’s to secure the workloads. But what if we need more deliberate segmentation? Aviatrix provides the concept of Security Domains. Let’s see how these work and what they can do for us.


## Lab 1.4 - Exploring the Aviatrix Gateways
### Description
As you can see from the lab diagram, there are already some Aviatrix gateways deployed. Let’s see where we can find them in the controller.
### Validate
Go to **_Multi-Cloud Transit -> List_**. As you can see, this is where the existing transit gateways are listed. Look at the following fields: Name, VPC CIDR, Spoke List and Transit Peering. Try to derive the existing topology as seen on the lab diagram from this information.  
### Expected Results
You should be able to view the VPC / VNET and Gateway Route Tables for both the Transit Gateways and Spoke Gateways.
